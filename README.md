# MovieWidget

Create a web component using vue.js that shows the top 5 box-office movies listed on Rottenn Tomatoes.

Users can swipe through movies to navigate.

Content should be pulled from the site to fill in the movie: Title, Description and Poster Image.

Clicking "View More" will take the user to the Rotten Tomatoes page.

Detailed UI specifications can be found on zeplin here. I have also invited you to the project for
collaboration where you can find font sizes, spacing and colors. Additionally I have attached a star graphic for the movie rating.

## Build & development
Run `gulp` for building and `gulp serve` for preview.
